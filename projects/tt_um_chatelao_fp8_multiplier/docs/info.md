## How it works

The project implements a **Streaming MXFP8 Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) Unit** based on the OCP Microscaling Formats (MX) Specification. It processes blocks of 32 elements using a shared 8-bit scale factor (UE8M0).

### Numerical Representation
The unit supports both **E4M3** and **E5M2** element formats:
- **E4M3**: 1-bit sign, 4-bit exponent (Bias 7), 3-bit mantissa.
- **E5M2**: 1-bit sign, 5-bit exponent (Bias 15), 2-bit mantissa.

### Operational Protocol (41-Cycle Standard / 25-Cycle Packed)
To minimize resource usage, operands are streamed into the unit over a fixed sequence:
1. **Cycle 1**: Load Scale A ($X_A$ on `ui_in`) and Configuration (on `uio_in`).
2. **Cycle 2**: Load Scale B ($X_B$ on `ui_in`) and Format B (on `uio_in`).
3. **Streaming Phase**:
   - **Standard Mode**: Cycles 3-34 (32 pairs of elements).
   - **Packed Lane Mode (FP4)**: Cycles 3-18 (16 cycles, 2 elements/cycle, dual-lane).
   - **Packed Serial Mode (FP4)**: Cycles 3-34 (32 cycles, packed byte every odd cycle, single-lane).
4. **Flush/Scale**: 2 cycles after the streaming phase ends.
5. **Output**: 4 cycles to shift out the 32-bit result on `uo_out`.

## How to test

The design uses a clocked FSM. To test:
1. Reset the unit (`rst_n` = 0) then enable it (`ena` = 1).
2. On Cycle 1, provide Scale A on `ui_in` and Config on `uio_in` (Set `uio_in[6]=1` for Packed Mode).
3. On Cycle 2, provide Scale B on `ui_in` and Format B on `uio_in`.
4. Stream elements $A_i$ and $B_i$:
   - **Standard**: 32 cycles.
   - **Packed Lane**: 16 cycles (two 4-bit elements per cycle: `[7:4]=E_i+1`, `[3:0]=E_i`).
   - **Packed Serial**: 32 cycles. Load a packed byte on odd cycles (3, 5...); Hardware waits on even cycles (4, 6...).
5. Wait 2 cycles for internal pipeline synchronization and shared scaling.
6. Read the 32-bit result from `uo_out` over 4 cycles (Byte 3 to Byte 0).

A Cocotb testbench in `test/test.py` performs this protocol and verifies the results.
