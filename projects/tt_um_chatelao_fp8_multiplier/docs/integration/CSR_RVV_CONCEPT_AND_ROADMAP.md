# CSR Mapping Concept & Implementation Roadmap: OCP MX for RISC-V

This document defines the conceptual mapping of the **OCP MX Streaming MAC Unit** to **RISC-V Control and Status Registers (CSRs)** and outlines the roadmap for full **ZvfofpXmin** integration.

## 1. Proposed CSR Layout

To manage the specific requirements of OCP Microscaling Formats (MX), a new custom CSR is proposed: `vmxfmt` (**Vector MX Format Configuration**).

### 1.1. `vmxfmt` (Custom Read/Write CSR, Address 0x800)

![vmxfmt Bitfield](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chatelao/ttihp-fp8-mul/main/docs/diagrams/VMXFMT_BITFIELD.PUML)

| Bits | Name | Description | OCP MX Cycle 1 Mapping |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| [2:0] | **FMT_A** | Element Format for Tensor A. | `uio_in[2:0]` |
| [5:3] | **FMT_B** | Element Format for Tensor B. | `uio_in[2:0]` (Cycle 2) |
| [6] | **OVF** | Overflow Mode (0: Saturation, 1: Wrap). | `uio_in[5]` |
| [7] | **EXT** | Extended Accuracy (MX+) Enable. | N/A |
| [31:8] | **RES** | Reserved for future use (e.g., MX++). | - |

#### Format IDs (FMT_A / FMT_B)
| ID | Format | Type |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `000` | E4M3 | MXFP8 |
| `001` | E5M2 | MXFP8 |
| `010` | E3M2 | MXFP6 |
| `011` | E2M3 | MXFP6 |
| `100` | E2M1 | MXFP4 |
| `101` | INT8 | MXINT8 |
| `110` | INT8_SYM | MXINT8 |

### 1.2. Standard RVV 1.0 CSRs

The Bridge unit tracks the following standard Vector CSRs as defined in the RISC-V Vector Extension 1.0.

| Address | Name | Privilege | Description | OCP MX Relevance |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `0x008` | **vstart** | URW | Vector start position. | Restart index for bit-serial streaming. |
| `0x009` | **vxsat** | URW | Fixed-point saturation flag. | Accumulator saturation sticky bit. |
| `0x00A` | **vxrm** | URW | Fixed-point rounding mode. | Mapped to OCP MX Rounding Mode. |
| `0xC20` | **vl** | URO | Vector length. | Number of elements in the current operation. |
| `0xC21` | **vtype** | URO | Vector data type register. | Encodes SEW and LMUL. |
| `0xC22` | **vlenb** | URO | VLEN/8 (bytes). | Design-time constant. |

#### `vtype` Layout
| Bits | Name | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| [XLEN-1] | **vill** | Illegal value bit. |
| [7] | **vma** | Mask Agnostic (0: Undisturbed, 1: Agnostic). |
| [6] | **vta** | Tail Agnostic (0: Undisturbed, 1: Agnostic). |
| [5:3] | **vsew** | Selected Element Width (e.g., 000 for 8-bit). |
| [2:0] | **vlmul** | Vector Register Grouping (LMUL). |

## 2. Integration with Standard RISC-V CSRs

### 2.1. Rounding Mode (`vxrm` / `frm`)

For fixed-point OCP MX operations, the **`vxrm`** CSR (Vector Fixed-Point Rounding Mode) is used. For standard floating-point operations, the **`frm`** field is used.

| `vxrm` / `frm` | OCP MX Rounding Mode | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `00` / `000` | **RNE** (11) | Round to Nearest, ties to Even. |
| `01` / `---` | **RNU** (--) | Round to Nearest, Up (Add +0.5 LSB). |
| `10` / `001` | **TRN** (00) | Round down (towards -Infinity). |
| `11` / `---` | **ROD** (--) | Round to Odd (Jamming). |

*Note: OCP MX v1.0 primarily specifies RNE, TRN, FLR, and CEL. Mapping RVV's 2-bit `vxrm` requires careful aliasing of floor/ceil to the closest fixed-point semantics.*

### 2.2. Saturation Flag (`vxsat`)
Sticky bit set if any element in the 32-element block triggers saturation.

## 3. Operational Flow in a RISC-V System

1. **Vector Config**: `vsetvli t0, a0, e8, m1, ta, ma` (Setup RVV state).
2. **MX Config**: `csrrw x0, vmxfmt, t0` (Set OCP MX formats/overflow).
3. **Instruction**: Issue `vdot.mx v1, v2, v3` (Custom-0 Opcode).
4. **Execution**: The RVV-to-MX Bridge fetches operands from VRF, respecting `vstart` and `vl`, and drives the 41-cycle MAC sequence.
5. **Result**: 32-bit result is written to destination VRF; `vxsat` updated; `vstart` reset to 0.

---

## 4. RVV to MX Bridge Module

The "RVV to MX Bridge" acts as the hardware shim between the RISC-V Vector Register File (VRF) and the 41-cycle streaming protocol of the OCP MX MAC unit.

### 4.1. Functional Responsibilities
- **Operand Fetch**: Translates vector register addresses into a sequential stream of 8-bit elements.
- **Protocol Synchronization**: Drives the `ui_in` and `uio_in` pins of the MAC unit based on the internal FSM state.
- **Result Back-Pressure**: Buffers the 32-bit accumulated result and triggers the VRF write-back sequence.

## 5. Implementation Roadmap

### 5.1. Overall Strategy (Gesamtplan)

| Variant | Description | Pros | Cons |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **A: Phased Modular Integration** | Incremental build-up: 1. CSR logic, 2. Bridge logic, 3. ISA decoding. | High testability; stable milestones. | Slightly slower initial "visible" progress. |
| **B: Vertical Feature Slicing** | Full path for one format (e.g., E4M3) first, then expand to others. | Faster end-to-end demo. | Higher risk of major rework when adding complex formats (MX+). |
| **C: Simulation-First Wrapper** | Develop a Cocotb/SystemC wrapper that emulates the VRF before RTL. | Early software toolchain testing. | Risk of mismatch between emulated and real hardware timing. |

**Selection & Justification**: **Variant A** is chosen. In an ASIC context (Tiny Tapeout), modular verification is paramount. Establishing the CSR foundation first ensures that the configuration logic is robust before dealing with complex streaming timing.

### 5.2. Sub-step 1: CSR Implementation

| Variant | Description | Justification |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **1.1: Centralized CSR Unit** | A dedicated module handles all custom CSR addresses (0x800+). | **Selected**: Best separation of concerns. Makes the ISA extension modular and reusable across different MAC implementations. |
| **1.2: Distributed Shadow Regs** | Latch configuration directly in the MAC's FSM, mapped to the bus. | Saves a few gates but makes timing analysis harder as configuration logic is interleaved with arithmetic logic. |
| **1.3: Bus-Mapped Config Window** | Use a single "data" CSR and an "address" CSR to access internal state. | High latency for configuration; complex software driver required. |

### 5.3. Sub-step 2: VRF-to-Stream Bridge

| Variant | Description | Justification |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **2.1: Asynchronous FIFO Buffer** | Use a small 8-entry FIFO to decouple VRF read-latency from MAC timing. | **Selected**: Provides immunity against pipeline stalls or memory wait-states. Essential for a reliable 41-cycle streaming guarantee. |
| **2.2: Tightly-Coupled Lane** | MAC FSM stalls the entire CPU pipeline until the 32 elements are read. | Simple hardware but devastating for system performance (32+ cycles of blocking). |
| **2.3: DMA-Style Transfer** | Software configures a DMA to move data from memory to the MAC unit. | Avoids VRF pressure but requires complex interrupt handling and memory management logic. |

### 5.4. Sub-step 3: ISA Integration & Decoding

| Variant | Description | Justification |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **3.1: Dedicated OCP Opcode** | Define a new `vdot.mx` instruction in the custom-0/1 opcode space. | **Selected**: Cleanest ISA integration. Enables compiler optimizations and follows the standard RISC-V extension path. |
| **3.2: CSR-Triggered Execution** | Writing to a specific control bit in `vmxfmt` starts the operation. | Non-standard; hard to pipeline in a superscalar or out-of-order core. |
| **3.3: ALU Re-purposing** | Reuse `vdot.vv` with a specific state bit in `vtype`. | Causes confusion with standard floating-point operations; breaks IEEE-754 compatibility expectations. |

### 5.5. Sub-step 4: RVV 1.0 Compliance

| Variant | Description | Justification |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **4.1: State Machine (vstart/vl)** | Implement an FSM that respects `vstart` (restart index) and `vl` (truncation). | **Selected**: Essential for standard RVV compliance and resumable traps. |
| **4.2: SEW/LMUL Decoder** | Hardware logic to decode `vtype` and adjust streaming window (e.g., $k=VLMAX$). | Enables future flexibility for non-32 element blocks. |

## 6. SERV CPU Integration Concept

### 6.1. Architectural Challenge: The Bit-Serial Impedance Mismatch
SERV is a bit-serial RISC-V CPU, meaning it processes 1 bit per cycle and takes 32 cycles for a standard 32-bit operation. The OCP MX Bridge, however, expects a byte-serial stream (8 bits per cycle) to drive the MAC unit's 41-cycle protocol. Integrating these two requires a transformation between bit-serial dataflow and the bridge's byte-oriented FSM.

### 6.2. Evaluated Integration Variants

| Variant | Description | Pros | Cons |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **6.2.1: Wishbone-Attached Peripheral** | The Bridge/MAC unit is treated as a memory-mapped peripheral on the Wishbone bus. | Minimal CPU modification; standard software access. | High overhead (latency for bus arbitration); difficult to fit in 1x1 tile due to bus logic. |
| **6.2.2: Extension-Interface (MDU-style)** | Leverages SERV's extension interface. The bridge captures instructions and serial data directly from the CPU's internal shift registers. | High efficiency; bypasses the bus; low gate count. | Requires modification of the CPU core to support the custom OCP opcode. |
| **6.2.3: Shadow Shift-Register Bridge** | A separate 32-bit shift register snoops the CPU's write-back data. Once "full" (after 32 cycles), it parallelizes the byte for the MAC bridge. | No timing impact on CPU; asynchronous processing. | Duplicate registers (32-bit buffer) increase area, threatening the 1x1 tile limit. |

### 6.3. Evaluation & Selection

**Selection**: **Variant 6.2.2 (Extension-Interface)** is selected for the minimal implementation.

**Justification**:
- **Area Efficiency**: By hooking into the existing bit-serial datapath (similar to how the MDU/Multiplier unit is integrated), we avoid 32-bit parallel buffers. We can accumulate bits into an 8-bit shift-register (part of the Bridge) every 8 CPU cycles.
- **Protocol Alignment**: Since SERV takes 32 cycles to "produce" a 32-bit register value, and the MAC unit expects 32 elements, the timing is naturally aligned for a low-gate-count implementation.
- **1x1 Tile Target**: This variant minimizes "dead" silicon used for bus interconnects or large buffers, maximizing the area available for the MAC arithmetic logic.

### 6.4. Dataflow for Minimal SERV Integration (RVV 1.0 Compliant)
1. **Instruction Decode**: CPU executes `vdot.mx` (custom opcode).
2. **Loop Initialization**: Bridge initializes internal element index $i = vstart$.
3. **Serial Stream**:
   - CPU shifts out `rs1` and `rs2` (or VRF chunks) bit-by-bit.
   - Bridge collects bits into 8-bit elements.
   - Elements are ignored until $i \ge vstart$.
   - Execution terminates when $i = vl$ (truncation).
4. **FSM Drive**: Every 8 cycles, if $vstart \le i < vl$, the Bridge feeds one element to the MAC unit.
5. **Post-Processing**: MAC Unit runs the 41-cycle sequence; Bridge resets `vstart` to 0 on successful completion.
